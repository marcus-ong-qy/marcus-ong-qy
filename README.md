- 🎓 Hello! I'm an undergraduate in NUS Engineering Science Programme (ESP)
- 🤖 I'm interested in R&D, Robotics, and tinkering with code and hardware!
- 👨‍💻 I'm currently a Frontend Lead in [@rhdevs](https://github.com/rhdevs) developing an [app](https://rhapp.lol) for Raffles Hall residents!
- 🌱 In my free time, I like to explore and work on random stuff, such as my [repo of all my casual hardware projects](https://github.com/marcus-ong-qy/casual_projects) and this [resistor code quiz app](https://github.com/marcus-ong-qy/resistor-code-quiz-app)
